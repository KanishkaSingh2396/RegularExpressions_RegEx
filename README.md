# RegularExpressions_RegEx
To translate this to simple-speak: regular expressions are a series of patterns that can be used to perform powerful matching operations when simple wildcards and find/replace utilities stop being useful.

Some interesting scenarios where regex is commonly deployed include:

Making sure passwords are strong enough
Identifying whether an email address is valid
Validating credit card number inputs from different providers (Visa, Amex etc)
Checking for valid address inputs
Making sure IP addresses are in the right format
Validating URLs
Checking for valid bitcoin addresses
And for some more regular use cases in SQL:

Identifying specific patterns in a long string to identify customers
Searching for multiple date formats in a free-text field
Find and replacing multiple substrings without nested SUBSTRING functions
Identifying matched patterns and re-inserting them to create a new text field (this is super useful!)
